# onebytwo
The one by two harkens to a simpler time, where denmark's simple pad printing technology heavily limited the number of switches your clip shaped yellow hands could accomodate. Using the familiar QERY layout and a 3u spacebar for maximum compatibility, the 1x2 sits a full 35mm off your desk surface with 0Â° of tilt for optimal ergonomics.

# parts required

- 1* 1x2 pcb
- 1* 1x2 3d printed case
- 1* pro micro, with 24 male headers (generally included)
- 28* cherry mx style or smk switches
- 28* 1n4148 diodes
- 1* set of cherry mx compatible alpha keycaps, and a 3 unit spacebar
- 1* cherry pcb mount 3u stabiliser

# pcb
Grab the zip and order a pcb through your favourite pcb manufacture service. I used JLCPCB. 

# case
The case is 3d printed. 3d print it. 

# construction
1. Solder in the diodes and pro micro headers first, and trim them close to the pcb. There isn't much space for legs. 
2. Mount the stabiliser and do all of the stabiliser-related tweaking that you want to do.
3. Fit the pcb into the case and solder the switches.
4. Weasel the pro micro into the case and solder it down. This part sucks. This keyboard sucks.
5. Install keycaps.

The pro micro must be installed component side up. Check the slot in the case to see if you have it installed the right way, as it will be immediately obvious if it's wrong.
